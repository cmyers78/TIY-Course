Questions for Student to Answer

What led you to the Iron Yard?

Tell me a bit about your previous job. What about it made you decide to change careers?

How much experience do you have with computers? Macs?

What background (if any) do you have in programming or programming related activities (could include IT work or technical support)?

What attracted you to TIY vs. something like Code School/Treehouse or even a more traditional school like SSC or UCF (insert local university here)?

Are you aware of the 60-80 hr/week class commitment? How do you feel about that?

What are your thoughts on failure? How would you feel about an activity where you succeeded only maybe 5-10% of the time?

Why do you want to build iOS apps vs. something like websites or desktop software?

If you were to graduate from Iron Yard, what do you plan to do with your new skills?

Overview of Class

Class schedule: e.g. 9-12 lecture, lab until 5 or 6

70-80 hours: talk about how very few students work less than this.

Students work together: talk about the after-lecture environment and how students communicate and work together.

Daily and weekend homework: A smallish assignment is assigned every day, and a larger assignment for Thur-Sun

Only 4 absences allowed: If you miss more than 4 lectures, you're no longer eligible for job placement, but you can still finish the course.

Homework done on time to the instructors satisfaction: the objectives of the assignments will be specified as clearly as possible, but ultimately the assessment of completion is left up to the instructor. If assignments are not completed, you're no longer eligible for job placement, but you can still finish the course.

Be kind: we think this is super important, not just for our sanity, but also for the success of all our students.

Work hard and you can get placed in a job: we have a 100% placement rate, and are confident that anyone who does the work we ask of them can get a job.

Final project: the last 3 weeks, there's no homework and reduced lecture time, usually more catered to what students need for their projects.

Demo day: at the end, we demo our projects in front of employers and alumni.

Do you have any questions for me?

Email to send after the interview with links to some programming tutorials

It was nice talking to you today. Here are some links to check out more info on building iOS apps. I would encourage you to give one of these a try before you decide for sure to enroll, just to make sure you enjoy it. There is a lot of failure involved in programming, but that feeling of sweet success can be very motivating.

Here's a link to Xcode. If you open this on your Mac, it should open the Mac App Store app automatically. If not, there is a button on the webpage to open it. Once in the App Store, just click the "get" button.

Here's the Try iOS course from CodeSchool. It is free to try, but I think you have to make an account.

Here is a more traditional tutorial from Ray Wenderlich. He's got a lot of great stuff on his site. This one is for brand new programmers. It's less guided than the Code School approach, but there is also less overhead. You pretty much just read the tutorial and follow along in Xcode.

I hope these are helpful. If you try any of them, let me know what you think.
