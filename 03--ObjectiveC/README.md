### Homework -- Weekly News

A significant part of being a developer is keeping up with technology, especially in mobile, and particularly in iOS. We get significant changes at least 2x a year (one for hardware and one for software), and sometimes even more often. It's difficult, if not impossible, to keep up. One way to try to keep up is to keep tabs on the weekly news. So, every week you will have an assignment to find an article and share it with the class.

MINIMUM requirements for this assignment:
* Find a _unique_, _recent_ news article and share it to the iOS class on Slack
* UNIQUE: You must be the first to share that topic on Slack. A similar article on the same topic does not count.
* RECENT: It must be from the last 7 days, ideally within the last few days
* I am the ultimate arbiter of unique & recent
* Be prepared to discuss your (and everyone else's article) in the next lecture
